# Miscellaneous_Programming_Work

This repository contains miscellaneous codes written by Linfeng.

**Toolkits_Memory** contains several functions written for preprocessing and visualizing memory task data.

**Toolkits_Analysis&Visualization** contains several functions written for processing and visualizing experimental data (e.g., behavioral data from two/three experimental groups).

**Ensemble_Paradigm** contains several scripts written for behavioral experiments studying ensemble perception. The codes uploaded in this folder were specifically written for a project in collaboration with Dr. Tao Yang and Mr. Yingxin Qi.

**EEG_Analysis_Sample** contains the codes written for preprocessing and analyzing EEG data using the Fieldtrip Toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011).
